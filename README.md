CockUI is a fluidly in development UI Library for GZDoom/UZDoom.

CockUI is currently under development specifically for Selaco (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/) but is freely available use in any GZDoom/UZDoom project.

There are no official releases yet as everything is subject to change during development. No documentation or support will be provided until an official generic release is made.

Note: Some features rely on engine tweaks specific to Selaco but can easily be removed or altered.


If you are using CockUI in your project I would love to hear about it, and what went wrong!<br/>
It would also be really cool if you could include a CockUI logo somewhere in your UI/Startup Sequence/Credits.  
Logos are provided in /Icon/
